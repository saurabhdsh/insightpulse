## **INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 0:30)**

*"In today's digital landscape, customer feedback is more valuable than ever, but most organizations struggle to turn that feedback into actionable insights. Traditional feedback management systems are reactive, slow, and often miss critical patterns that could transform customer experience.*

*Introducing InsightPulse - the world's first AI-powered feedback management platform that doesn't just collect feedback, but actively analyzes, prioritizes, and drives resolution through intelligent automation. What makes us different? We're the only solution that combines real-time feedback collection, AI-powered analysis, and automated incident resolution in one seamless platform."*

## **CORE FEATURES OVERVIEW (0:30 - 1:00)**

## **VOICE OF CUSTOMER ANALYZER DEMO (1:00 - 1:45)**

*"Now, let me demonstrate our flagship feature - the Voice of Customer Analyzer. This is where InsightPulse truly shines. Watch as our AI agents automatically analyze customer feedback, identify root causes, and create actionable resolution plans.*

*Here we see a customer experiencing login issues. Our AI has automatically detected the problem, analyzed the session recording, and assigned it to the appropriate team.

Each case is automatically prioritized, routed, and tracked through resolution. This level of automation and intelligence is unprecedented in the industry."*

## **AI IDEATION & TREND ANALYSIS (1:45 - 2:15)**

*Our trend analysis reveals that 85% of feedback is positive, with technical issues being the primary concern. The AI automatically detects patterns, such as increased login problems after recent updates, and generates actionable recommendations.*

*What's unique here is that every suggestion comes with impact metrics, implementation timelines, and success criteria - making it easy for product teams to prioritize development efforts."*

## **INCIDENT MANAGEMENT & AUTOMATION (2:15 - 2:45)**

*"When critical issues are detected, InsightPulse automatically creates ServiceNow incidents and routes them to the right teams. Our incident management system has reduced response time by 38% and increased deployment frequency by 5x per month.*
