# InsightPulse Demo Video Narration Script (4 Minutes)

## **INTRODUCTION (0:00 - 1:00)**

*"In today's digital landscape, customer feedback is more valuable than ever, but most organizations struggle to turn that feedback into actionable insights. Traditional feedback management systems are reactive, slow, and often miss critical patterns that could transform customer experience.*

*Introducing InsightPulse - the world's first AI-powered feedback management platform that doesn't just collect feedback, but actively analyzes, prioritizes, and drives resolution through intelligent automation. What makes us different? We're the only solution that combines real-time feedback collection, AI-powered analysis, and automated incident resolution in one seamless platform.*

*Before we dive into the platform, let me share why this matters. Companies using traditional feedback systems spend an average of 48 hours just to categorize and route customer issues. That's two full business days before anyone even starts working on the problem. Meanwhile, customer satisfaction drops, support costs rise, and valuable insights are lost in the noise.*

*InsightPulse changes everything. We're helping organizations reduce response time by 85%, increase customer satisfaction by 40%, and turn feedback into revenue-driving features. Now, let me show you exactly how this revolutionary platform works."*

## **CORE FEATURES OVERVIEW (1:00 - 1:30)**

*"Let me show you how InsightPulse transforms feedback management. Our dashboard provides real-time visibility into customer sentiment, response times, and active issues. With over 2,500 feedback responses processed and a 4.2 out of 5 satisfaction score, we're delivering measurable results.*

*The platform integrates seamlessly with Qualtrics for automated feedback collection, eliminating manual data entry and ensuring 100% data accuracy. Our AI engine processes feedback in real-time, automatically categorizing issues and detecting emerging trends before they become problems."*

## **VOICE OF CUSTOMER ANALYZER DEMO (1:30 - 2:15)**

*"Now, let me demonstrate our flagship feature - the Voice of Customer Analyzer. This is where InsightPulse truly shines. Watch as our AI agents automatically analyze customer feedback, identify root causes, and create actionable resolution plans.*

*Here we see a customer experiencing login issues. Our AI has automatically detected the problem, analyzed the session recording, and assigned it to the appropriate team. Notice how the AI agent has already identified that the session timeout is too aggressive and suggested extending it to 30 minutes.*

*The VoC Analyzer provides complete visibility into customer journeys, including session recordings, technical details, and AI-generated insights. Each case is automatically prioritized, routed, and tracked through resolution. This level of automation and intelligence is unprecedented in the industry."*

## **AI IDEATION & TREND ANALYSIS (2:15 - 2:45)**

*"But InsightPulse doesn't stop at problem resolution. Our AI Ideation engine analyzes feedback patterns to generate data-driven feature suggestions. Based on customer sentiment and usage patterns, it's suggesting improvements like faster claims processing and enhanced provider portals.*

*Our trend analysis reveals that 85% of feedback is positive, with technical issues being the primary concern. The AI automatically detects patterns, such as increased login problems after recent updates, and generates actionable recommendations.*

*What's unique here is that every suggestion comes with impact metrics, implementation timelines, and success criteria - making it easy for product teams to prioritize development efforts."*

## **INCIDENT MANAGEMENT & AUTOMATION (2:45 - 3:15)**

*"When critical issues are detected, InsightPulse automatically creates ServiceNow incidents and routes them to the right teams. Our incident management system has reduced response time by 38% and increased deployment frequency by 5x per month.*

*The platform automatically detects incident patterns, provides AI-generated root cause analysis, and tracks resolution progress. Teams can see real-time updates, AI insights, and automated recommendations for similar issues.*

*This level of automation means problems are identified and resolved faster than ever before, leading to improved customer satisfaction and reduced operational costs."*
